# svite-ravencss
① test of [svite](https://github.com/dominikg/svite) (svelte with hot module reloading) ② with the «raven css technique» (technique with css variables to have *container* media queries -media queries at the level of container without any javascript nor media queries, just css vcariables-)

This example is a proof of css technique coming from the [article from _Mathias Hülsbusch_](https://css-tricks.com/the-raven-technique-one-step-closer-to-container-queries/)
